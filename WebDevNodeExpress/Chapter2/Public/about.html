		<p>On Thursday, that same 4,300-horsepower machine will carry Bushâ€™s casket, along with relatives and close friends, for around 70 miles (113 kilometers). The journey through five small Texas towns was expected to take about two and a half hours. It will deliver the casket from suburban Houston to College Station.<p>
